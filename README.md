# EVI1_CTBP2_PLDLSinhibitor

This is all custom R and python code associated with our manuscript:
"Oncogene EVI1 Drives Acute Myeloid Leukemia Via a Targetable Interaction with CTBP2"

## AlphaFold

* Data for script (the predicted structures, as well as the ChimeraX output) is available on Zenodo INSERT DOI
* chimerax_quantification.RMD is the R script required to generate the input for the AlphaFold heatmaps
* python_cmds_chimerax_*.py are python scripts for quantification of interaction. Running these scripts *within* ChimeraX will generate interaction tables like the ones available for this project. 

## ChIP-seq correlation plots
* data for script is normally generated from BAM files
* for the purpose of recreating the plots a count matrix of associated files is also uploaded

## Data availability
* open data is available on Zenodo
* this includes all tables for flow cytometry, luciferase measurements (in vivo and for MAPPIT assay) and mass-spec results
* all predicted alphafold structures are available on Zenodo
